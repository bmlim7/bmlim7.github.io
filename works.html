                        <h6> By: Bianca Marie C. Lim </h6>
                        <p> Political activist, journalist, and death row convict, Mumia Abu-Jamal, once said that,</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p id="it"> “Prison is a second-by-second assault on the soul,
                        a day-to-day degradation of the self, an oppressive steel and brick umbrella that transforms seconds into hours and hours into days.” </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>He is one out of ten million inmates worldwide facing the dehumanizing effects of an oppressive and overcrowded prison system, an issue that is slowly plaguing the globe, forming hell on earth for many detainees. Alas, humanity has outdone itself in the maltreatment of its fellow human beings, completely disregarding any form of compassion for the mere embezzler or thief, and indiscriminately forcing a fate worse than death to all. <span id="un"> This godawful neglect of the prison system, as well as the basic rights and liberties of these people, must not stand, and I am to propose a simple, humane, and efficient alternative to finally solve this crisis for the betterment of society. </span></p>

                        <p> The Penal Reform International stated that, “prisons in over 124 countries exceed their maximum occupancy rate.” This greatly undermines the ability of a prison to meet basic human needs, such as healthcare, food, and accommodation, and it also augments mental health problems and the rates of violence, self-harm, and suicide. This is obviously present in the Philippines, a country with more than 200,000 prisoners (World Prison Brief, 2019). For instance, Manila City Jail’s prisoner capacity is about 1100 inmates; however, by the end of 2018, there were approximately 6300 inmates crowded in the facility. That’s about six times the capacity limit, and because of this, last September 30, 2019, at least two people were killed and 32 others injured from a riot that began with two inmates (Inquirer.net, September 2019). </p>
                        
                        <p> The government really hasn’t given much attention to this social issue. In fact, political prisoners, who are just as malevolent as ordinary inmates or maybe even worse, are held in a private prison, which holds a diminutive number of prisoners, and are subjecting their inmates to benevolent treatments. This act debilitates the unity and equality of our country, and is just another way to aggrandize overcrowding.A similar experience to a life sentence in prison, but with more flaws and exploitation because according to the Death Penalty Information Center, death penalty cases were counted with the median cost of 1.26 million dollars per case. </p>

                        <p> The induced arbitration to resolve the issue of overcrowding is the death penalty, a complete façade to hide the cruelty of murder and implementation of moral corruption—does it sound familiar?This is 70% more than the cost of a non-death penalty case, and is 8 times more expensive than exercising a life sentence. Treason, parricide, murder, infanticide, rape, kidnapping, and importation of drugs are just some of the crimes that are punishable by death penalty (Philstar Global, December 7, 2016). These crimes make up for 80% of the offenses committed around the world wherein most carry on with a death penalty case that pays for legal costs, pre-trial costs, appeals, etc. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <div class="contenttwo">
                        <p> Therefore, to set all of these errors right, my simple solution tackles the root of the problem. Not the prison system nor the politicians, but the prisoners. If we contain all of the prisoners in a large arena and allow them to battle each other to death wherein the last man standing will be rewarded with a prisoner’s deepest desire, freedom, we would be able to fix the problem of overcrowding in jails, and we would not let an innocent man to kill, since all of those prisoners are already guilty of barbaric crimes. In addition to this, the 1.26-million-dollar fund for every death penalty case could be dedicated to other causes like research, education, or for those experiencing poverty. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the amnesty records about 20,000 death penalty cases per year. That is around 25 billion dollars annually which would be enough to end the poverty in the whole world in about 140 years. More than 700 million people in the whole world would be given a new hope to live a more reposeful life. </p>

                            <h6> Prison's Unknown Battlegrounds </h6>
                        </div>

                        <p>Although, there is one irrational outcome to this solution—why should a murderer or a drug addict be freed? Well, they shouldn’t be. It is only the fuel to ignite the battle among the prisoners, but the actual survivor would still be secretly imprisoned, along with the other “winners” of the battles. Their life sentences would just go on, and they would die eventually. So, if each battle is among 500 prisoners, instead of housing 100% of the prisoners subjected to the death penalty, the prisons would only house 0.002% of them which would surely enfeeble the issue of overcrowding, and even discourage egregious acts.	</p>

                        <p> The idiosyncratic people leading our country have overlooked opportunities to implement prison reforms, criminal justice prosecution reforms, reforms of mandatory minimums in sentencing or at least heavy informative campaigns to spread awareness of this issue. Instead, they hopped on the extremes of ordering an executioner, an innocent man, to kill. As lovers of the extreme, this proposal then should be quotidian to them. </p>

                        <p> Ultimately, overcrowding in prisons have caused tons of black-hearted transgressions. These offenses are done, not by the prison, but by the prisoners there and so, they are the root of this global dilemma. Life is a battle itself, and so should death be. A battle amongst miscreants. How can you have an overcrowded prison without prisoners? Thus, I rest my case. </p>
